## Reduce Complexity with Middleware as a Service

As a Platform as a Service, or PaaS, Platform.sh automatically manages everything your application needs in order to run. That means you can, and should, view your infrastructure needs as part of your application, and version-control it as part of your application.

Platform.sh is a PaaS built especially for continuous deployment with the goal of making it easier to move your project to cloud-computing to deploy anywhere and anytime. Using the Maven Archetype, you can create a REST project with Payara Micro and move the project to Platform.sh.

In this guide:

* Hello World with Payara Micro and Platform.sh
* Payara Platform with JPA
* Payara Platform with NoSQL
* Payara Micro, Platform.sh and Microservices


This repository has three Payara and Platform.sh samples:


* [Hello](hello) A simple Hello world rest with JAX-RS
* [JPA](jpa) A relational database integrated with Jakarta EE. It is a restful application with JPA and PostgreSQL
* [Nosql](nosql) A NoSQL database integrated with Jakarta EE. It is a restful application with Jakarta NoSQL and MongoDB.
